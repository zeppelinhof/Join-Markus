            <p>Welcome to the help page for <span class="lightBlue">Join</span>, your guide to using our kanban project
                management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of what <span class="lightBlue">Join</span> is, how it
                can
                benefit you, and how to use it.</p>
            <h2>What is Join?</h2>
            <p><span class="lightBlue">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
                group
                of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie. <br>
                <br>
                Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="lightBlue">Join</span> leverages the
                principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
                <br>
                <br>
                It is important to note that <span class="lightBlue">Join</span> is designed as an educational exercise
                and
                is not intended for extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user
                experience,
                we cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality

            <h2>How to use it?</h2>
            <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span class="lightBlue">Join</span>:</p>

                    <h3 style="margin: 0;">Exploring the board</h3>
                    <p style="margin: 0;">When you log in to <span class="lightBlue">Join</span>, you'll find a default
                        board. This board
                        represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await
                        feedback”
                        and "Done".</p>
                </div>

                <div class="description">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0;">Creating Contacts</h3>
                    <p style="margin: 0;">In <span class="lightBlue">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on
                        your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required
                        information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the
                        tasks
                        on the board.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="description">
                    <h3 style="margin: 0;">Adding Cards</h3>
                    <p style="margin: 0;">Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards
                        represent
                        individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in
                        the
                        task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin: 0;">Moving Cards</h3>
                    <p style="margin: 0;">As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board
                        by
                        dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.</p>

                    <h3 style="margin: 0;">Deleting Cards</h3>
                    <p style="margin: 0;">Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete
                        it.
                        Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting
                        cards, as this action is irreversible.

                        Remember that using <span class="lightBlue">Join</span> effectively requires consistent updates
